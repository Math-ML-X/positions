    <h2>Project Summary</h2>
    <br>
  </div>
</div>
<p>
  Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is vital for diagnosing diseases like cancer, heart conditions, and neurological disorders. However, conventional PET/CT imaging exposes patients to radiation from tracers and CT scans.  This Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)-funded project aims to address these challenges by creating data-driven models to enable high-quality, low-dose PET imaging, reducing radiation risks and enhancing accessibility without compromising diagnostic accuracy. This position focus on three main streams:
<br>
1.	<b>Denoising of Low-Dose PET Images:</b> Developing models to reduce noise and enhance the quality of PET scans acquired at lower radiation doses.<br>
2.	<b>CT-Free Attenuation Correction:</b> Developing AI-driven techniques for PET imaging that eliminate the need for CT scans, reducing radiation exposure and associated costs. <br>
3.	<b>Robust Image Reconstruction and Synthesis:</b> Using deep learning to create high-quality PET and CT images from low-dose PET data to support accurate, non-invasive diagnostics.<br>
This work aims to advance personalized, non-invasive diagnostic techniques, making PET imaging safer and more accessible in clinical practice.
